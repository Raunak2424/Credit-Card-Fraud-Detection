# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

ðŸ§© 4. Example of What Model Might Learn (Simplified Intuition)
Transaction Pattern	Example Behavior	Likely Outcome
Amount very high compared to userâ€™s history	User rarely spends â‚¹10,000+, but suddenly does	Possible fraud
Sudden burst of 5+ transactions in 2 minutes	Normal users rarely do that	Possible fraud
Location changed drastically (Delhi â†’ London) within 10 mins	Impossible physically	Likely fraud
Merchant unusual for the user	e.g., user never bought electronics before	Possible fraud
Common spending pattern	Same city, similar amount	Legitimate

(Note: In the Kaggle dataset, location & merchant details arenâ€™t available, but banks use them in production.)
